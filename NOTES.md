First Project - Apex Legends

I want to build an application that will help new Apex Legends players pick the right Legend for them. 

The application should load information about each Legend, including their current stats (from players, global), information on their abilities and their character bio. 

Users of the application will be able to generate a suggestion of a player based on criteria from stats, such as Win%. 

Once a user has a suggestion of a Legend, they should be able to see more information on that Legend, including their stats, abilities and character bio.
